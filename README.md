Steps used and challenges faced to build this application:-
-----------------------------------------------------------

    Steps:
    ------
    👉 Used MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture for developing the console application.
    👉 Added the required Models, Views and Controller along with Interface implementation to achieve abstraction.
    👉 Added user-defined exceptions to catch anf handle the exceptions.
    👉 Used encapsulation to hide data and used getter and setter for getting and setting the data for the models.
    👉 Used "ArrayList" to store and manipulate data according to the user preferrences.
    👉 Used "CSV" Files for handling data.
    👉 Stored the file path, Scanner class other sensitive information in a separate Utility folder.
    👉 Used Singleton pattern to avoid creating objects.
    👉 Used "Date" class for handling date for orders.
    👉 Handled exceptions for invalid choices.

    Challenges:
    -----------
    🔴 Faced "concurrentmodificationexception" - Caught this exception while working with Java collections.
        -> Solved it by not making any changes while the iterator is working on a ArrayList.
    🔴 Faced "StackOverFlow" - Caught this while creating parallel objects through constructor.
        -> Solved it by passing the instance "this" to other constructor.
    🔴 Had a problem while trying to update the cart count of a user product in the "CSV File".
        -> Solved it by storing the cart data by reading the "CSV File" and storing it in a ArrayList and updating the Arraylist and                 Writing it again to the "CSV File" by deleting and creating the file again.
